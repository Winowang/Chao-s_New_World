The main network strcuture is in this Network.py 
and Loader.py is used to load the image file.

To load the image file by using the 
following commands:

>>> import mnist_loader
>>> training_data, validation_data, test_data = \
... mnist_loader.load_data_wrapper()


After loading the image file 
setting up a Network with 30 hidden neurons

>>> import network
>>> net = network.Network([784, 30, 10])

The stochastic gradient is used to learn from the MNIST training_data 
with a mini-batch size of 10, and a learning rate of mu=3.0 mu=3.0,

>>> net.SGD(training_data, 30, 10, 3.0, test_data=test_data)
